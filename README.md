# Around the States in 78 Days: An Analysis of My Summer Roadtrip

This project explores data from my recent cross-country road trip, focusing on driving mileage, fuel efficiency, hiking distances, biometric data, and expenses. The aim is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate visualizations to derive insights that could enhance future travel experiences.

## Explore the Analysis

You can access the full analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/keeganmcgarry/roadtrip_analysis/blob/main/Roadtrip%20Data%20Analytics.ipynb).

## Key Questions

- What are the basic descriptive statistics for each of the above mentioned categories of data?
- Are there any interesting insights that can be derived from combining or comparing data from one or more of these categories?
- What can I learn from this data that would improve my travel experience for future trips?

## Data

For privacy reasons, I put the data that I used for my analysis in a private repo and pulled it into this one as a submodule. If you have any suggestions for improvement or would like access to the data, you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keeganmcgarry/).
